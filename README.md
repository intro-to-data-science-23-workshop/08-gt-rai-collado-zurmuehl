# Working with **gt** and **gtExtras**


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2023.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the production of tables with R and the packages **gt** and **gtExtras**. Tables are an important part of publishing data scientists' work, and the choices made while formatting it can make a difference in the public's understanding of the data and the study itself. These packages allow for the production of tables with data in the *dataframe* or *tibble* format, as well as easy formatting of various elements. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the **gt** and **gtExtras** packages and table producing workflow, (2) show you the basic functions the package, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
