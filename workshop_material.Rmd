## Short Recap: What does gt package do?

It produces nice display tables which are different from the data tables.

A display table is something which you often come across like tables in a web page, a journal article, or in a magazine.

**Note:** The display tables are output only and we are not going to use them as input ever again.

## What more can gt do?

It helps in annotations, table element styling, and text transformations that serve to communicate the subject matter more clearly.

**Example time - let's see how does the gt package works**

**But before that - some basics:**

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("gt")
#install.packages("gtExtras")
#install.packages("svglite")
library(gt)
library(tidyverse)
library(gtExtras)
library(svglite)

```

**A sneak peek into the dataset we are going to use - I hope you love "PIZZA"**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data("pizzaplace")
```

"pizzaplace" is an in-built dataset under the gt package. 

It has information about 32 different types of pizza in 4 different categories: classic, chicken, supreme, and veggie. 

**Let's take a look at our dataset:**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
names(pizzaplace)
head(pizzaplace)
```
Before using the gt package we need to have a table. Let's create a table from our dataset using the dplyr functions.

The table we are creating is this: **Total Sales by Pizza Size (2015)**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Group the data by pizza size and calculate total sales for each size
total_sales_by_size <- pizzaplace %>%
  group_by(size) %>%
  summarise(total_sales = sum(price))

# Calculate the overall total sales
overall_total_sales <- sum(total_sales_by_size$total_sales)

# Add a last row for overall total sales
total_sales_by_size <- total_sales_by_size %>%
  add_row(size = "Overall Total", total_sales = overall_total_sales)

# Print the result
total_sales_by_size
```

Okay, so now we have a table.
And here is the first use of gt on the new table - making a display table:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
gt_table1 <- gt(total_sales_by_size)
gt_table1
```
**Note:** The main entry point into the gt API is the gt() function. If we pass total_sales_by_size to the function gt(), we’ll get a gt Table as output.

That doesn't look too bad? It's really basic but hey we didn't ask for much:)

Now we will go ahead and learn about adding parts of a gt Table - if you remember the shiny table from the Presentation:). A brief on them:

* the Table Header (optional; with a title and possibly a subtitle) 
* the Stub and the Stub Head (optional; contains row labels, optionally within row groups having row group labels and possibly summary labels when a summary is present)
* the Column Labels (contains column labels, optionally under spanner column labels)
* the Table Body (contains columns and rows of cells)
* the Table Footer (optional; possibly with footnotes and source notes)

The way that we add parts like the Table Header and footnotes in the Table Footer is to use the **tab_*()** family of functions. 
A **Table Header** is easy to add so let’s see how the previous table looks with a title:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Adding title to our display table
gt_table1 <- gt_table1 %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Total Sales by Pizza Size (2015)"
  )
gt_table1
```

## Execise 1:The Top 5 Best Selling Pizzas
We want to get the best selling pizzas from this list. Also include the size and price and calculate the total revenue for each pizza.

How would you go about it?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
top_5_pizzas <- pizzaplace %>% 
  group_by(name, size, price) %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  mutate(rev = price * n) %>% 
  ungroup()

top_5_pizzas
```
So the top selling pizza combination is the small big_meat pizza! 

**Exercise 1:** Lets change the table into a gt object and:

* give it a title and subtitle and make the title bold (hint: use the md() function for that)
* insert spanner label to signify that the price and revenue figures correspond to the year 2015
* change the column names into presentation ready names
* round the revenue numbers to the nearest dollar, eliminating any decimal points

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# Insert your answer here. Use https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/index.html as reference for the needed functions

```
## Solution Exercise 1: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
top_5_table <- gt(top_5_pizzas) %>% 
  tab_header(title =  md("**Top Five Best Selling Pizzas**"),
             subtitle = md("Most Sold Pizza Combinations in 2015")) %>% 
  tab_spanner(label = "In 2015",
              columns = c(n, rev)) %>% 
  cols_label(
    name = "Pizza Name",
    size = "Pizza Size",
    price = "Price",
    n = "Pizzas Sold",
    rev = "Revenue per Pizza") %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = rev, decimals = 0)

top_5_table
```

## Exercise 2: Bringing Color into gt-Tables

Aditya:

## Exercise 3: Using gtExtras

In the next exercise we will be using **gtExtras** to go above an beyond.
* Create a bar plot in every row that indicates the revenue from each pizza
* Use the New York Times theme
* Add a picture next to the title representing your favorite pizza. Use a picture URL from the web 

```{r}
# Insert your answer here. Use https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/reference/index.html as reference for the needed functions
```
## Solution for Exercise 3: 
```{r}
top_5_table %>%
  gt_plt_bar(column = rev, keep_column = TRUE) %>% 
  gt_theme_nytimes() %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = add_text_img(
      "Top Five Best Selling Pizzas",
      url = "https://images.ctfassets.net/nw5k25xfqsik/64VwvKFqxMWQORE10Tn8pY/200c0538099dc4d1cf62fd07ce59c2af/20220211142754-margherita-9920.jpg?w=1024"
    ))

```
# Thank You for Your Attention

Further exercises for your own practice:
Do you wanna work your way through a new dataset from the basics, then this script is for you. Just follow along and enjoy the process. Always remember the steps: first from the main dataset you should have a table ready for the outside world and then you use the gt package for formatting your display table.
```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("gt")
# install.packages("gtExtras")
# library(tidyverse)
# library(gt)
# library(gtExtras)



# Loading and getting a preview of the dataset
data("presidential")
head(presidential)
names(presidential)

# Let's make a new table from this dataset. I want a table with the President and their party affiliation
name_party <- presidential %>%
  distinct(name, party)
name_party
```
Now the first step: Change the table in gt object.
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution:**
```{r}
table1 <- gt(name_party)
table1
```
Add title and subtitle to our display table:
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution:**
```{r}
table1 <- table1 %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "American President and the Party",
    subtitle = "American Presidents and their party affiliation"
  )
table1
```
Let's make the title and subtitle standout - use of bold and italics:
Add title and subtitle to our display table:
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution:**
```{r}
table1 <- table1 %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**American President and the Party**"),
    subtitle = md("*American Presidents and their party affiliation*")
  )
table1
```
Don't forget to give the credits - rule no. 1 of good research practice (hint: use tab_source_note())
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution:**
```{r}
table1 <- table1 %>%
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = "Source: The 'presidential' package in ggplot2"
  )
table1
```
What to do if you want to share a information with your audience in the table: 
Add a footnote indicating that Kennedy only served two terms:
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution:**
```{r}
ttable1 <- table1 %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "He was president for only 2 years",
    locations = cells_body(columns = name, rows = 2)
  )
table1
```
Now we want two groups in the table - a group of democratic presidents and a group of republican presidents. 
Split up the table into two row groups:
```{r}

# Insert your solution here.

```
**Solution**
```{r}
table1 <- table1 %>%
  tab_row_group(
    id = "Republican",   # Unique ID
    label = "Republican Party",
    rows = c(1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11)
  ) %>%
  tab_row_group(
    id = "Democratic",   # Unique ID
    label = "Democratic Party",
    rows = c(2, 3, 6, 9, 10)
  )
table1
```
The table is ready and now we want to try out some functions from the **gtExtras** package.

Use the package to edit the table to look like the tables in a NYT articles:
```{r}
gt_theme_nytimes(table1)
```

I am a dark mode fan and I want my table in the dark mode:
```{r}
gt_theme_dark(table1)
```
There are many more things you can do with the gt and gtExtras. Don't forget you just have to put a question mark to get more information about them.
?gt
?gtExtras
