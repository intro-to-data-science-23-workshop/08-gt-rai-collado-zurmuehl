## The Top 10 Best Selling Pizzas
We want to get the best selling pizzas from this list. Also include the size and price and calculate the total revenue for each pizza. 
How would you go about it?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
top_5_pizzas <- pizza_place_raw %>% 
  group_by(name, size, price) %>% 
  count(name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  mutate(rev = price * n) %>% 
  ungroup()

top_5_pizzas
```
So the top selling pizza combination is the small big_meat pizza! 
## Using gt to Get the Table Presentation Ready
1. Now lets change the table into a gt object and:
- give it a title and subtitle and make the title bold (hint: use the md() function for that)
- change the column names into presentation ready names
- round the revenue numbers to the nearest dollar, eliminating any decimal points 
- insert spanner label to signify that the price and revenue figures correspond to the year 2015
- insert a 
```{r}



```
## Solution 1: 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
top_5_table <- gt(top_5_pizzas) %>% 
  tab_header(title =  md("**Top Five Best Selling Pizzas**"),
             subtitle = md("Most Sold Pizza Combinations in 2015")) %>% 
  tab_spanner(label = "In 2015",
              columns = c(n, rev)) %>% 
  cols_label(
    name = "Pizza Name",
    size = "Pizza Size",
    price = "Price",
    n = "Pizzas Sold",
    rev = "Revenue per Pizza") %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = rev, decimals = 0)

top_5_table
```
